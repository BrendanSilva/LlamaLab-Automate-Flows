This flow tries to reduce the length of a single line of text to make better use of space in phone messaging services. No redundancy dictionary is built in, which means that even very short messages can be compressed. It is a variation of the flow below:

Unlike the previous flow, this one embeds a second 'dictionary' in the text message that allows the insertion of numbers and symbols signaled by two reserved switching characters. A total of 54 characters can be used and the compression ratio can reach approximately 3/4.

☛ Important:

1)  This flow is *experimental*. Please test the decompression before using it.

2)  Unfortunately, the constant alternation between numbers/symbols (secondary dict.) and letters (primary dict.) in the message compromises the efficiency of this flow, so you should avoid this if you want better compression.

3)  As you know, of course, the receiver also needs to have this flow to 'decompress' the message. This flow doesn't send any SMS, but you can edit it to do that if you want.
