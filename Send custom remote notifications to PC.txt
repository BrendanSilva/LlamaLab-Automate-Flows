To use this flow, you need the "Remote Notifier" app (id: "org.damazio.notifier"), by Rodrigo Damazio, available on F-Droid and GitHub. It is free, open source and ad-free.

☛ How to use:

1)  After installing the app, follow the instructions to install the notification server for Windows, Linux or Mac OS. It is a small and lightweight Java program, so you will need the Java Virtual Machine.

2)  Configure the server to receive messages from 'third-party applications' and set a password. Go back to the application and enter the server's local network address.

3)  Now just run this flow by typing the custom message. That is all. Edit this flow as you wish.
