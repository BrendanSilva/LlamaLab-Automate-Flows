This flow tries to reduce the length of a single line of text to make better use of space in phone messaging services. No redundancy dictionary is built in, which means that even very short messages can be compressed. It is a variation of the flow below:

Unlike the previous flowchart, this one allows the insertion of numbers and symbols signaled by two reserved switching characters. A total of 54 characters can be used and the compression ratio can reach approximately 4/3.

☛ Important:

•  This flow is experimental. Please test the decompression before using it.

•  Unfortunately, the constant alternation between numbers/symbols (secondary dict.) and letters (primary dict.) in the message compromises the efficiency of this flow, so you should avoid this if you want better compression.

•  This flow uses all GSM-7 encoding characters, so consider unchecking the option that automatically removes accents and diacritics in your preferred messaging app.

•  As you know, of course, the receiver also needs to have this flow to decompress the message. This flow doesn't send any SMS, but you can edit it to do that if you want.
