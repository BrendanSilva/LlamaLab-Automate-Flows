☛  Important:

•  To see the output correctly, you have to paste the generated "banner" into any text field that uses a monospaced typeface (Courier, Droid Sans, Fixedsys, Lucida Console, etc.).

•  To see the list of all supported emoticons and dingbats, open flowchart block #6. The Automate community doesn't allow me to put the full list in the description.
