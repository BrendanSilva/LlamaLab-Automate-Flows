To use this flow, you need the app "Screenshot Tile (No Root)" (app id: "com.github.cvzi.screenshottile"), by Cuzi, available on F-Droid, GitHub and Play Store. It is free, open source and ad-free.

☛ How to use:

1)  Install the app. Follow the setup instructions in the built-in tutorial and set a password in the "Show password" field. Go to "Advanced settings" and set the timeout/delay to 0 (zero) milliseconds.

2)  Open the diagram of this flow. Edit the "Send broadcast" block, inserting the previously defined password in the "Extras" field.

3)  That's it. When you run this flow, the screenshot will be taken. This is considerably faster than Automate's default screenshot function.
