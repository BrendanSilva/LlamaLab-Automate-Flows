# LlamaLab Automate Flows
Some automation flowcharts for LlamaLab Automate (tested on Android Oreo).

Note:
Apparently Automate does not save the description of the ".flo" file if it is not downloaded from the community. Therefore, the description of each tool is in the last block of the respective flow. It just stores the description and can be deleted.
