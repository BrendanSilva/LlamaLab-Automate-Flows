This flow tries to reduce the length of a single line of text to make better use of space in phone messaging services. No redundancy dictionary is built in, which means that even very short messages can be compressed. It is a variation of the flow below:

Unlike the previous flowchart, this one does not use switch signaling characters, but a single bit per slice. This compression is more efficient in texts with a high frequency of alternation between the second dictionary and the first, which prioritizes the most used letters in the English language.

The average compression ratio is 1.37, including capital letters, numbers and basic punctuation marks.

☛ Important:

•  This flow uses all GSM-7 encoding characters, so consider unchecking the option that automatically removes accents and diacritics in your preferred messaging app. Please understand that this flowchart is experimental, so test it before sending the message.

•  As you know, of course, the receiver also needs to have this flow to decompress the message. This flow doesn't send any SMS, but you can edit it to do that if you want.
